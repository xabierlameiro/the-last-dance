# Possible solution for NPM - Failed to replace env in config: $\{NPM_TOKEN}

In this short post I am going to show a solution for the `Failed to replace env in config: ${{NPM_TOKEN}` error that occurs when trying to run a yarn or npm command.

You may have encountered this error at some point when trying to run a yarn or npm command. In my case it was
because I published one of my libraries on github and in order to install it from github, I needed a token.
This token is generated in github and stored in the system environment variables.

But it is necessary to create an .npmrc file in the root of the project and add the following content:

<CH.Code style={{maxWidth: 'max-content', margin: '20px 0'}}>

```bash .npmrc
@xabierlameiro:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

</CH.Code>

What can happen is that you leave this file outside the project folder and save it in the user folder,
for example in my case I saved it in the folder `C:\Users' and that's why I got the error.

To solve it, what I did was:

<CH.Code style={{maxWidth: 'max-content', height:'max-content', margin: '20px 0'}}>

```bash
yarn install --verbose
```

</CH.Code>

It showed me the paths where I was looking for the .npmrc file and I realised that I was using it from the user folder.

I **_deleted_** it from the user folder and recreated it in the root of the project and it no longer gave me the error.

> I hope that if the same thing happens to you, it will help.
